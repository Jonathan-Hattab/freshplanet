Minesweeper test challenge for FreshPlanet

## How to test the application ##

To test the application just launch the Minesweeper.jar !
You only need to have a Java installed on your computer but that is usually the case.

## How to view the code ##

To view the code you can use Eclipse (or Netbeans).
You just need to open eclipse with ./ as working directory.
Java is an OOP language so the code is divided between classes here.
I wrote Javadoc comments for each class so you can find all the information as you read the code.
